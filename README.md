1 Summary
The rice classification problem aims to predict the class of Cammeo rice and Osmancik rice,
which is being analyzed based on a dataset with summary measurements of rice derived from
image data. The dataset’s attributes are Area, Perimeter, Major and Minor Axis length,
Eccentricity, Convex Area, Extent, and which class it belongs to. The dataset contains 3,810
records. Eight attributes denote each row, and its class denotes the type of rice. The rice
classification problem using GP involves evolving mathematical expressions using a given
gp language consisting of functions (Arithmetic and other required functions) and terminals
provided within the dataset (7 attributes), and the end goal is to evolve an S-expression
that predicts the rice class. Overall, the rice classification problem using GP involves using
the dataset’s attributes as inputs to evolve mathematical expressions that can classify the rice
type.
