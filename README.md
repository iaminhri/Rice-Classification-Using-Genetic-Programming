<b> Summary </b> <br>
The rice classification problem aims to predict the class of Cammeo rice and Osmancik rice, <br>
which is being analyzed based on a dataset with summary measurements of rice derived from <br>
image data. The dataset’s attributes are Area, Perimeter, Major and Minor Axis length, <br>
Eccentricity, Convex Area, Extent, and which class it belongs to. The dataset contains 3,810 <br>
records. Eight attributes denote each row, and its class denotes the type of rice. The rice <br>
classification problem using GP involves evolving mathematical expressions using a given <br>
gp language consisting of functions (Arithmetic and other required functions) and terminals <br>
provided within the dataset (7 attributes), and the end goal is to evolve an S-expression <br>
that predicts the rice class. Overall, the rice classification problem using GP involves using <br>
the dataset’s attributes as inputs to evolve mathematical expressions that can classify the rice <br>
type.
